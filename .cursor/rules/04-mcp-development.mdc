# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Development Best Practices

You are an expert in FastMCP, Model Context Protocol, and AI tool development.

## Core Principles

- Design tools for AI agents, not humans
- Provide clear, structured responses
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- Support batch operations for efficiency
- Optimize for parallel execution
- Return machine-readable data with human-readable summaries

## FastMCP Server Structure

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import Optional
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Initialize MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("EasyPost MCP", dependencies=["easypost", "sqlalchemy"])

@mcp.tool()
async def create_shipment(
    to_address: dict,
    from_address: dict,
    parcel: dict,
    carrier_accounts: Optional[list[str]] = None
) -> dict:
    """
    Create a shipment with EasyPost and generate a shipping label.

    Args:
        to_address: Recipient address details
        from_address: Sender address details
        parcel: Package dimensions and weight
        carrier_accounts: Optional list of carrier account IDs to use

    Returns:
        Shipment details including tracking number and label URL
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        result = await easypost_service.create_shipment(
            to_address=to_address,
            from_address=from_address,
            parcel=parcel,
            carrier_accounts=carrier_accounts
        )

        logger.info("shipment_created", shipment_id=result["id"])

        return {
            "status": "success",
            "data": result,
            "message": f"Shipment created: {result['tracking_code']}"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("shipment_creation_failed", error=str(e))
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "message": f"Failed to create shipment: {str(e)}"
        }
```

## Tool Design Patterns

### 1. Single Responsibility Tools

Each tool should do ONE thing well:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def create_shipment(...):
    """Create a shipment (does NOT buy it)."""
    pass

@mcp.tool()
async def buy_shipment(shipment_id: str, rate_id: str):
    """Buy a specific rate for an existing shipment."""
    pass

@mcp.tool()
async def create_and_buy_shipment(...):
    """Convenience tool that creates AND buys in one call."""
    pass
```

### 2. Batch Operations

Support bulk operations with parallel processing:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def create_bulk_shipments(
    shipments: list[dict],
    max_workers: int = 16
) -> dict:
    """
    Create multiple shipments in parallel.

    Args:
        shipments: List of shipment data dicts
        max_workers: Number of parallel workers (default: 16 for M3 Max)

    Returns:
        Results with success/failure counts and details
    """
    async def create_one(shipment_data: dict) -> dict:
        try:
            result = await easypost_service.create_shipment(**shipment_data)
            return {"status": "success", "data": result}
        except Exception as e:
            return {"status": "error", "message": str(e), "data": shipment_data}

    # Process in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        create_one(shipment) for shipment in shipments
    ], return_exceptions=True)

    successes = [r for r in results if r.get("status") == "success"]
    failures = [r for r in results if r.get("status") == "error"]

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "total": len(shipments),
            "successful": len(successes),
            "failed": len(failures),
            "successes": successes,
            "failures": failures
        },
        "message": f"Processed {len(shipments)} shipments: {len(successes)} successful, {len(failures)} failed"
    }
```

### 3. Flexible Search/Filter Tools

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def search_shipments(
    tracking_code: Optional[str] = None,
    status: Optional[str] = None,
    carrier: Optional[str] = None,
    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    end_date: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 100
) -> dict:
    """
    Search shipments with flexible filters.

    All parameters are optional - at least one should be provided.
    """
    filters = {}
    if tracking_code:
        filters["tracking_code"] = tracking_code
    if status:
        filters["status"] = status
    if carrier:
        filters["carrier"] = carrier

    results = await db_service.search_shipments(filters, limit=limit)

    return {
        "status": "success",
        "data": results,
        "message": f"Found {len(results)} shipments matching criteria"
    }
```

### 4. Comprehensive Error Information

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def track_shipment(tracking_code: str) -> dict:
    """Track a shipment by tracking code."""
    try:
        result = await easypost_service.track_shipment(tracking_code)
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "data": result,
            "message": f"Tracking info retrieved for {tracking_code}"
        }
    except EasyPostNotFoundError:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "not_found",
            "message": f"Tracking number {tracking_code} not found",
            "suggestion": "Verify the tracking number is correct"
        }
    except EasyPostAPIError as e:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "api_error",
            "message": f"EasyPost API error: {e.message}",
            "code": e.code,
            "suggestion": "Try again later or contact support"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("tracking_failed", error=str(e), tracking_code=tracking_code)
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_type": "unknown",
            "message": f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"
        }
```

## Resources (Read-Only Data)

```python
@mcp.resource("easypost://carriers")
async def list_carriers() -> str:
    """List all available carriers and their capabilities."""
    carriers = await easypost_service.list_carriers()

    # Return formatted text for AI consumption
    output = "Available Carriers:\n\n"
    for carrier in carriers:
        output += f"- {carrier['name']} ({carrier['type']})\n"
        output += f"  Services: {', '.join(carrier['services'])}\n"
        output += f"  Countries: {', '.join(carrier['countries'])}\n\n"

    return output

@mcp.resource("easypost://shipment/{shipment_id}")
async def get_shipment(shipment_id: str) -> str:
    """Get details for a specific shipment."""
    shipment = await db_service.get_shipment(shipment_id)

    # Return structured text
    return f"""
Shipment: {shipment.id}
Tracking: {shipment.tracking_code}
Status: {shipment.status}
Carrier: {shipment.carrier}
Created: {shipment.created_at}

From: {format_address(shipment.from_address)}
To: {format_address(shipment.to_address)}

Label: {shipment.label_url}
"""
```

## Prompts (Guided Workflows)

```python
@mcp.prompt()
async def create_shipment_workflow() -> list[dict]:
    """Guide user through shipment creation."""
    return [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I need to create a shipment"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "I'll help you create a shipment. Please provide:\n1. Recipient address\n2. Sender address\n3. Package dimensions (length, width, height in inches)\n4. Package weight (in ounces)"
        }
    ]

@mcp.prompt()
async def bulk_shipment_workflow() -> list[dict]:
    """Guide through bulk shipment creation."""
    return [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I need to create multiple shipments"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": """I'll help you create bulk shipments efficiently.

Options:
1. Upload CSV file with shipment data
2. Provide shipments as JSON array
3. Use template to generate shipments

Which method would you prefer?"""
        }
    ]
```

## Testing MCP Tools

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_shipment_tool(mock_easypost_service):
    """Test create_shipment MCP tool."""
    # Arrange
    mock_easypost_service.create_shipment.return_value = {
        "id": "shp_123",
        "tracking_code": "EZ1234567890"
    }

    arguments = {
        "to_address": {"street1": "123 Main St", "city": "SF", "state": "CA", "zip": "94105"},
        "from_address": {"street1": "456 Oak Ave", "city": "LA", "state": "CA", "zip": "90001"},
        "parcel": {"weight": 12, "length": 10, "width": 8, "height": 6}
    }

    # Act
    result = await create_shipment(**arguments)

    # Assert
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert result["data"]["tracking_code"] == "EZ1234567890"
    mock_easypost_service.create_shipment.assert_called_once()

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_bulk_shipments_performance(mock_easypost_service):
    """Test bulk shipment creation performance."""
    shipments = [{"to_address": {...}, "from_address": {...}, "parcel": {...}} for _ in range(100)]

    start = time.time()
    result = await create_bulk_shipments(shipments, max_workers=16)
    duration = time.time() - start

    assert result["data"]["successful"] == 100
    assert duration < 40  # Should complete in <40s on M3 Max
```

## Response Format Standards

All MCP tools should return consistent response format:

```python
{
    "status": "success" | "error",
    "data": {...},  # Main response data
    "message": "Human-readable summary",
    "metadata": {  # Optional
        "duration_ms": 123,
        "request_id": "uuid",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    },
    "error_type": "validation_error",  # For errors
    "suggestion": "Try X"  # For errors
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution
```python
# Good: Process items in parallel
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    process_item(item) for item in items
])

# Bad: Sequential processing
results = []
for item in items:
    result = await process_item(item)
    results.append(result)
```

### Caching
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
async def get_carrier_accounts():
    """Cache carrier accounts (they rarely change)."""
    return await easypost_service.list_carrier_accounts()
```

### Rate Limiting
```python
from asyncio import Semaphore

async def rate_limited_operation(items, max_concurrent=10):
    """Limit concurrent operations to avoid rate limits."""
    semaphore = Semaphore(max_concurrent)

    async def limited_call(item):
        async with semaphore:
            return await api_call(item)

    return await asyncio.gather(*[limited_call(item) for item in items])
```

## Documentation Standards

Every tool must have:
1. Clear docstring explaining purpose
2. Typed parameters with descriptions
3. Return type specification
4. Example usage in comments
5. Error conditions documented

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def calculate_shipping_cost(
    from_zip: str,
    to_zip: str,
    weight: float,
    dimensions: dict[str, float]
) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate shipping cost for a package.

    Args:
        from_zip: Origin ZIP code (5 digits)
        to_zip: Destination ZIP code (5 digits)
        weight: Package weight in ounces
        dimensions: Dict with 'length', 'width', 'height' in inches

    Returns:
        Dict with rates from all available carriers

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ZIP codes are invalid
        EasyPostAPIError: If EasyPost API fails

    Example:
        >>> await calculate_shipping_cost(
        ...     from_zip="94105",
        ...     to_zip="90001",
        ...     weight=12,
        ...     dimensions={"length": 10, "width": 8, "height": 6}
        ... )
        {
            "status": "success",
            "data": {
                "rates": [
                    {"carrier": "USPS", "service": "Priority", "rate": "12.50"},
                    {"carrier": "UPS", "service": "Ground", "rate": "15.75"}
                ]
            }
        }
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Key Conventions

1. **Tool Naming**: Use clear, action-oriented names (`create_shipment`, not `shipment`)
2. **Batch Support**: Provide both single and bulk versions of operations
3. **Error Handling**: Always return structured error information
4. **Performance**: Leverage parallel processing for bulk operations
5. **Logging**: Log all operations with structured logging
6. **Testing**: 100% coverage for all MCP tools
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings with examples
